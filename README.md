Application Description:

This application is designed to capture real-time video streams along with the deviceâ€™s GPS location and transmit the data to a Django backend server for processing, storage, or live viewing. The frontend component, built using Node.js, interfaces with the device's camera and location services to continuously capture video frames and geographical coordinates. These data streams are then efficiently sent to the Django server using HTTP or WebSocket protocols, ensuring minimal delay and synchronized video-location transmission.
